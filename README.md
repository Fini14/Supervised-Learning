# Supervised-Learning
This project uses the most popular classification techniques to predict the outcomes after extensively working on EDA treating missing values and imbalanced data. This project has two parts. Part 1-Predicting the condition of the patient depending on the received test results on biomechanics features of the patients according to their current conditions. Part 2-Build an AIML model to perform focused marketing by predicting the potential customers who will convert using the historical database.
# Skills and Tools: 
Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Classification, Python, SVM, Linear regression
# Part A:
# DOMAIN:
Medical
# CONTEXT: Medical research university X is undergoing a deep research on patients with certain conditions. University has an internal AI team. Due  to  confidentiality  the  patient’s  details  and  the  conditions  are  masked  by  the  client  by  providing  different  datasets  to  the  AI  team  for developing a AIML model which can predict the condition of the patient depending on the received test results.
# DATA  DESCRIPTION: 
The  data  consists  of  biomechanics  features  of  the  patients  according  to  their  current  conditions.  Each  patient  is represented in the data set by six biomechanics attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the condition to their body part.
# PROJECT  OBJECTIVE:
To Demonstrate the ability to fetch, process and leverage data to generate useful predictions by training Supervised Learning algorithms.
# Part B:
# DOMAIN:
Banking, Marketing
# CONTEXT:
A bank X is on a massive digital transformation for all its departments. Bank has a growing customer base whee majority of them are liability customers (depositors) vs borrowers (asset customers). The bank is interested in expanding the borrowers base rapidly to bring in more business  via  loan  interests.  A  campaign  that  the  bank  ran  in  last  quarter  showed  an  average  single  digit  conversion  rate.  Digital  transformation being  the  core  strength  of  the  business  strategy,  marketing  department  wants  to  devise  effective  campaigns  with  better  target  marketing  to increase the conversion ratio to double digit with same budget as per last campaign.
